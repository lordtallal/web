												<h3>Addressing Urbanisation and Population crisis in Pakistan.</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The objective of this research is to examine the population and urbanisation crisis in Pakistan, with a focus on investigating the factors contributing to the rapid rise of urbanisation in select districts. Existing literature on the topic primarily addresses the negative consequences of overpopulation, but overlooks the reasons behind the concentration of population in only a few districts. To address this gap, this research aims to identify the key variables driving the increase in population and urbanisation in Pakistan, and explores the issue of uneven distribution of population and urban areas across the country. The research contends that urbanisation and population growth can be beneficial if they are distributed equitably, but the current situation in Pakistan calls for a closer examination. The research methodology involved integrating data from various sources to perform an analysis and develop a machine learning model to identify the most significant variables related to the research problems.</p>

												<h3>Forecast Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A forecast analysis project was undertaken with the objective of creating a dashboard using Google Data Studio for enhanced data visualization. The dashboard was developed to aid in the analysis of data for an undisclosed client. The project involved the integration of multiple data sources to generate forecasts based on historical trends. Statistical models were utilized to forecast future trends and identify potential opportunities for the client. The resulting dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the client's business metrics and aided in identifying areas for improvement. Overall, the project contributed to improved decision-making capabilities and helped the client achieve better results.</p>

												<h3>Sales Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The objective of this project was to conduct sales analysis for a client by creating a dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The sales data was collected and organized into a database, which was then used to generate charts, tables, and graphs to provide valuable insights into the client's sales performance. The dashboard provided a clear overview of key performance metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and product sales. These metrics were analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. The resulting insights helped the client to make data-driven decisions to optimize their sales strategy and improve overall business performance.</p>

												<h3>Movies Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For a personal project, I conducted a movies analysis using SQL and Tableau to gain insights into the movie industry. The data was collected from different sources and preprocessed in Python before visualizing it in Tableau. The aim was to identify patterns in the data and to find answers to various research questions. The analysis included factors such as genre, release year, rating, and box office revenue. The resulting dashboard in Tableau was interactive and provided a clear and concise overview of the findings. The project helped me to improve my skills in data analysis and visualization while also providing valuable insights into the movie industry.</p>
